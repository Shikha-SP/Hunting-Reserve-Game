<h1>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve</h1>

My first Unity project, inspired by Nepal’s Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. I created this game while learning Unity and Blender over 1.5 months, combining my passion for wildlife, conservation, and game development.

Hunting Reserve is a first-person exploration and shooting game set in Nepal’s only legal hunting reserve. Designed to be both educational and engaging, the player’s objective is to explore the reserve and collect 100 points by hunting permitted wild animals such as the Himalayan Blue Sheep, Tahr, and Wild Boar. Players must avoid shooting endangered species like the Red Panda, Danphe, and Musk Deer, or domestic animals like goats, as doing so results in arrest. Predators like the Snow Leopard and Himalayan Black Bear can also pose a threat and may eat the player if approached too closely.

The game features a point-based scoring system, raycast shooting mechanics, realistic terrain, and custom animations, providing an immersive gameplay experience while raising awareness about wildlife conservation.
